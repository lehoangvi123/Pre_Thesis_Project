# project1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Introduction

This project is a Personal Expense Management Application developed as part of an undergraduate thesis in Information Technology. The main goal is to help users track, analyze, and optimize their personal finances through an intuitive mobile interface and intelligent AI-based insights.

Users can easily record their income and expenses, categorize transactions, and visualize their financial habits through interactive charts such as pie charts and line charts. To go beyond basic tracking, the system integrates an AI analysis module that evaluates spending patterns and provides smart saving suggestions — for example:

“This month, your spending on food is significantly higher. Consider reducing it by 20% to improve your savings.”

The application is built using Flutter for cross-platform mobile development, with Firebase/Node.js providing the backend infrastructure and real-time data synchronization. The AI features are powered by an OpenAI API, enabling personalized financial recommendations based on user behavior.

This project aims to demonstrate not only the technical implementation of a modern mobile app but also how AI can enhance personal financial management, helping users build healthier spending habits and achieve their financial goals.
